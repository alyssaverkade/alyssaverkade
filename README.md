Hi! I'm a programmer that specializes in systems programming and really enjoys large scale distributed system design

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently (sporadically) working on a distributed mapreduce implementation called [neuromancer](https://github.com/alyssaverkade/neuromancer) where jobs are cli programs compiled to LLVM bitcode
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m working my way through [The Book of Proof](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/) and scaling up my mathematical literacy
- :heart: I'm always up for learning new things, cooking, and listening to lofi
