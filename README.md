Hi! I'm currently a programmer @CozyCo, helping people have more peace of mind about paying their rent every month.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a distributed mapreduce implementation called [neuromancer](https://github.com/alyssaverkade/neuromancer) where jobs are cli programs compiled to LLVM bitcode as well as an HTTP server
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about high performance networking, and large scale distributed system design
- :heart: I'm always up for learning new things, cooking, and listening to lofi
